# backup-scripts

This is a small experiment in using [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka). For this initial experiment, I'm going to try and replace some bash scripts (mostly crimped from [here](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/raspberry-pi-as-backup-server-for-linux-and-windows/)) with a Clojure script instead. This is very unlikely to be a good example for anyone else.
